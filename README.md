`restopt` is an ecological restoration planning software which is specifically designed to identify connected,
accessible, and compact areas for ecological restoration, with an emphasis on reducing habitat fragmentation and
increasing habitat connectivity.

For a detailed description of the problem solved by `restopt`, please refer to the following research article:

"*Constrained optimization of landscape indices in conservation planning to support ecological restoration in New
Caledonia*", by Dimitri Justeau-Allaire, Ghislain Vieilledent, Nicolas Rinck, Philippe Vismara, Xavier Lorca, and
Philippe Birnbaum (https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2664.13803).

Since version 2.0.0, there is no more CLI (command-line interface). We recommend users to use the R interface [`restoptr`](https://github.com/dimitri-justeau/restoptr), which provides many utilities to consistently prepare the input data.
